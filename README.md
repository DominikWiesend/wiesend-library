## About myself
My name is Dominik Wiesend, I'm born in 1992, I had a wonderful childhood except of a very traumatic experience, I wasn't bad at school but I didn't liked it to be there, this was the reason for me to start my working career at an age of 15, I did an vocational training at Ziemann & Urban GmbH for becoming a IT systems electronics engineer, during the vocational training I found myself a new fervor for programming and coding, after my vocational training I leaved that company and became a new employee at BSH Hausger√§te GmbH, shortly after starting my work at the new company I found the wife of my dreams and we did become parents of a wonderful daughter and only a few years later we became a wonderful son too, since them I changed the position within the same company several times to come my wish work closer, being a awesome fulltime programmer.

## People that inspired me
### James Craig, he is the Batman of Programmers. 
[Most of my library is copied from his!]
<br />
<br />Have you ever thought about why Batman is as effective as he is? I mean sure he's rich, in better shape than any of us will ever be, and is a master at martial arts, but what almost always wins the day for him is that utility belt. It's the never ending supply of gadgets and utilities that he can use in the appropriate situation that really saves the day. And Craig's Utility Library is the same for programmers.
<br />
<br />With .Net we have a number of built in classes and functions to help make a programmer's life easier, but let's face facts, they didn't think of everything. Craig's Utility Library tries to fill in some of those gaps (or at least the ones that I've run into). It comes with a couple hundred extension methods, built in data types such as a BTree, priority queue, ring buffer, etc. And that's just the DataTypes namespace. When you add it all up, Craig's Utility Library is one of the largest set of utilities for .Net out there.
